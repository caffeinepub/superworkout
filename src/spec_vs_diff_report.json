  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to BodyAnalysisPage.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json. The BodyAnalysisPage.tsx file displays muscle mass estimation in the results but the diff is truncated before showing the actual styling/color implementation. Without seeing the complete rendering code where the Muscle Mass value text color is applied, it's difficult to conclusively verify that REQ-10's acceptance criteria are fully met.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Update the Muscle Mass estimation value text color to match the styling used for the Body Fat % and Confidence values",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated and does not show the JSX rendering section where the text color styling would be applied to the Muscle Mass value. While the file shows muscle mass calculation logic, the critical styling code that would demonstrate color consistency with Body Fat % and Confidence values is not visible in the truncated diff.",
